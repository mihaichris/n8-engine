# n8-engine
Semantic Search engine

## Description

N8 is a search engine that performs indexing and searches in semantic documents, based on fields with literal values. The documents that work with this search engine are semi-structured, encoded in the Resource Description Framework format (a format that provides a standard for merging and creating semantic links between ontological resources in Semantic Web).
